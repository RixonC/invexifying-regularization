# invexifying-regularization

This is an implementation of the invexifying regularization framework in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11027v1).

## Dependencies

I recommend using a conda environment. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and the packages `matplotlib` and `tqdm`. Also, have a working LaTeX installation for `matplotlib`. Note, [reproducibility with PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html).

## Example: Binary Classification With Squared-loss

Run with `python bcwsl.py`.

## Example: Variational Auto-Encoder

Run with `python vae.py`.
